# KabinsFirstEverRepository

## Took a long time to create the first one. 

### This is my first ever repository in GitHub which I am creating whilst working on the course called GitHub Fundamentals by Gill Cleeren.

#### Here, I'll be learning the basic fundamentals of working with GitHub that'll include
*  - Repositories
   - Collaboration using GitHub Flow
   - Tracking Issues and creating releases
   - Tasks Automation with GitHub Actions
   - GitHub Wiki Creation
